# distribution-shifts


## Background

In this notebook, covariate shift and prior probability shift will be discovered.

For sake of simplicity, the definitions of the shifts are:

- Covariate shift: Shift in independent variables.
- Prior probability shift: Shift in target variable.

For more detailed explanation, please refer to this [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/practical-issues-in-data-science-part-2-distribution-shift-part-1-416754c01905).

From the result of the notebook, we can basically see that removing the covariate and prior probability shifts help to reduce the MAE.
